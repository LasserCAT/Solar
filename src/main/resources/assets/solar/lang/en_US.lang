#Book
guide.brokenaltar.info=My father used to tell me stories about holy altars that could catch energy out of thin air. The Ancients used this energy to their advantage. Creating magical beings and using the energy to shape the world around them. It seems I have stumbled upon one of these altars and was able to repair it. If I hadn’t it would have probably crumbled to dust any time soon. The pillars around the altar look like menhirs that have corroded over the thousands, maybe even millions of years. But they did somehow survive. I should look into this further and write down my findings in this book that I found inside the altar. This is going to be an exciting journey!

guide.celestialaltar.info=Now that I have repaired one of the altars it is taking in some sort of energy. I am not so sure about it creating energy out of thin air.. it think its collecting solar and lunar energy. I can see different kinds of energy flows depending on day and night. I still need to learn more, but I think I can start looking for more clues as to how to use the altar. Maybe start with the strange trinket I found.

guide.ritualamulet.info=Taking a good look at the trinket I think it was an amulet. But it has been worn down so much I might as well try to make a new one. It looks like I just need some more gold and silver. I wonder if it triggers a reaction when I put it on the altar.

guide.menhir.info=The broken down menhirs seem to be shifted around the altar by the land over the years. I do not think their position is right.. Marks on the ground tell me that they were more symmetrically placed around the altar. I can probably recreate the menhirs by placing three Stone Blocks on top of eachother. Maybe the Ritual Amulet also plays a role in this? Let’s see if I can trigger a reaction again.

guide.runes.info=The menhirs seem to have slots burned into their bodys. They look like they can hold some sort of item. I tried carving some wood into items of the same exact size and shape but with all my effort it did not seem to have any effect. I placed them in the slot and they fell right out again. In anger I threw some of the wooden planks on top of the altar and they started to float! I think I figured it out. I will be calling them runes.

guide.runeinfuser.info1=Sometimes when I walk past some chests I hear items rumbling. I decided to throw everything out and also throw a rune on the ground. The rune started attracting some of the items! I forgot which though.. I should try this again and remember what the reagents were.

guide.runeinfuser.info2=The items on the ground do not seem to be doing much more than attracting eachother.. Sometimes I see them trying to merge but it will not succeed. I might have an idea as to how I can create a structure that will allow them to accept energy from the altar to aid the infusion. I can simply place a rune and one of the reagents in the infuser and see if it will work! I should be careful, once I place a reagent it might become bounded. I think I can remove it with my amulet though.

guide.runeinfuser.info3=My father used to tell lots of stories about ancient times. One of them was that there exist different worlds. And each world would have a certain affinity. Some might be the same but they can also be different. Will this have any effect on the reagents for infusing? I guess the only way to find out it by trying.

guide.runeinfuser.craftinginfo=I can create 2 types of foci that should be able to accept radiating energy from the Celestial Altar. One using gold and the other using silver.

#Book Rituals

guide.spells.info=Some rituals are build out of spells. These spells will be stored in your Ritual Amulet. Right click on the target block of your choice and something should happen. If nothing happens it means you probably didnt click on the right block. More lore for this will be added later on! Amulets get energy from a ritual. Using the spells might empty the energy and then the ritual will release from the amulet

guide.rituals.info=Every menhir right now is 4 blocks away from the altar if aligned with it. So 3 blocks in between the menhir and altar. Every ritual needs 8 menhirs. You should be able to see where to place them according to the pictures. They will get replaced with special paages that show how a ritual has been build.
