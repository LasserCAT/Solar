guide.brokenaltar.info=There are broken altars scattered all over the world in biomes that have the best view of the sky. You can easily spot them by looking for broken menhirs that look like worn down pillars around the altars. These altars need to be repaired before I can do anything with them it seems. Right now I think one altar will suffice. But I may need to gather more for more difficult times.

guide.celestialaltar.info=Now that the altar is repaired it seems to be collecting energy. If only I could do something with this energy. I’ll have to see if I can make an item that will be able to channel the energy to some form of sorts.

guide.ritualamulet.info=The Amulet is used for channeling rituals and spells. The basic Amulet can only hold a spell and once its used it’ll disappear. Then you have to do the ritual again to use the spell again. The basic Amulet is made by placing a dull amulet on the altar. This will turn into a Ritual Amulet.

guide.menhir.info=It seems like the broken and worn down totems around the altar are menhirs. I can see some kind of slot in one of the menhirs. Looking like it can hold an item that is of use to the altar. I must be able to recreate the menhirs… why don’t I try putting 3 blocks of stone on top of each other. Will the amulet trigger a reaction when I use it on the altar?

guide.runeinfuser.info=Now that I have created these magic stones I need to slot them with items. I should be able to create something that channels power from one item onto another. I should be able to create runes with different magical traits.
guide.runeinfuser.craftinginfo=These focusses have 2 types. One created with gold and the other with silver.

guide.runes.info=My father used to tell me stories about ancient magicians who used runes to channel power. I have tried carving runes myself for over 2 days. They are the exact size and form needed to be slotted into the menhirs, but they wouldn't be accepted. In anger I threw some wood on the altar.. then the wood started to float!
